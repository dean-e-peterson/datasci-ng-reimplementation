# datasci-ng-reimplementation
Materials from Andrew Ng's original Coursera machine learning course, and Dean's attempt to reimplement in Jupyter notebooks

**Note: Most of this material is probably copyright Coursera and/or Andrew Ng and/or Stanford.** It is here as a convenience as I try to reinforce my machine learning education by re-implementing the same algorithms in Jupyter Notebooks.
